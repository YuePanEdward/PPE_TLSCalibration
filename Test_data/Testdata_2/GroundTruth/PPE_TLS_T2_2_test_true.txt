% Scanner name (character array) - brand / type of scanner (used for
% logging of results and for checking that only data of one scanner
% are used for calibration)

SCNNAM = Superscan 2000


% Scanner serial number (character array) - serial number of the scanner

% scanner are used for calibration)

% Scanner position (fixed/observed/approximate coordinates and variance
% information, expressed in external coordinate frame):
% X/m, Y/m, Z/m, std/m (1 value, equal std for all 3 coordinates),
% or varX/m^2 varY/m^2 varZ/m^2 (3 values, variances; coordinates assumed
% to be uncorrelated) or vectorized lower triangle of full covariance
% matrix (6 values in m^2); std = 0 for fixed scanner position, NaN
% for unknown values (given coordinates are then interpreted as approximate
% values; default)

% The coordinate frame (right handed? left handed? orientation of axis?)
% is defined below

% Scanner orientation (fixed/observed/approximate rotation angles of
% scanner axes with respect to external coordinate system, and associated
% variance information):
% omega/deg, phi/deg, kappa/deg, std/deg (1 value, equal std for all 3
% angles), or var_omega/deg^2 var_phi/deg^2 var_kappa/deg^2 (3 values,
% variances; angles assumed to be uncorrelated) or vectorized lower 
% triangle of full covariance matrix (6 values in deg^2); std = 0 for 
% fixed scanner position, NaN for unknown values (given angles are then
% interpreted as approximate values)
%
% The external coordinate system is the same one as for the above 
% coordinates, the angles are Euler angles relating the scanner
% coordinate system Xs to the external system Xe according to
% Xs_i = R3(kappa)*R2(phi)*R1(omega)*(Xe_i-Xe_s) i.e., if both
% systems are right-handed, and the respective z-axes are approximately
% vertical, kappa is the rotation about the z-axis of the Xe system 
% (positive if the Xe system is rotated counter-clockwise),
% phi is the rotation about the y-axis, positive for counter-clockwise 
% rotation), omega is the rotation about the x-axis, positive for clockwise
% rotation. If the scanner is approximately upright, kappa is the
% azimuth of its x-axis, phi is the inclination of the x-axis (positive
% if the positive x-axis of the scanner dips below the horizon), omega
% is the inclination of the y-axis (positive if the y-axis raises above 
% the horizon).
